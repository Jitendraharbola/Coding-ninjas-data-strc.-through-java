You are given an integer array 'A' of size 'N', sorted in non-decreasing order. You are also given an integer 'target'.



Your task is to write a function to search for 'target' in the array 'A'. If it exists, return its index in 0-based indexing. If 'target' is not present in the array 'A', return -1.

public class Solution {

public static int search(int []nums, int target){
int low = 0;
int high = nums.length-1;
while(low<=high){
int mid = low + (high-low)/2;
if(nums[mid]==target){
return mid;
}
if(nums[mid]<target){
low = mid + 1;
} else {
  high = mid-1;
            }
        }
                return -1;
        }
    }
